# Direct-Drive In-wheel Motor

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSEVCNV/motor/master/motor.png "Direct-Drive In-wheel Motor")

This is the most versatile component of the project. 

It will need to replace the [internal combustion engine ICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine), transmission box and break of a wheel its applied. It makes at least engine, transmission, clutch, gas tank, exhaust and ignition system useless compared to regular ICE-car.

It will also need to have high torque in order to accelerate vehicle to (at least) speed of 140km/h and regenerative braking to stop it effectively. If the regenerative braking is not strong enough, In-Wheel motors can be installed to rear wheels and front wheels continue to use disk brakes. Front wheel installation is still the most optimal solution.

In-Wheel motor should be care-free, but maintainable and tire changes should be able to complete using conventional tools.

Desired engine size should be anything from 50kw/120V/250Nm upwards and typical setup would include two engines (100kw+ in total). Why? This reflects to most common cars at European markets today (like [VW Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf_Mk7#Engines)).

Are these requirements realistic? Yes. There are already multiple players on the market that are making commercial solutions. Some of those include [Protean](https://www.proteanelectric.com/), [Elaphe](https://in-wheel.com/en/), [Orbis](https://orbisdriven.com/), [Franke](https://www.frankedirectdrive.com/en/), [Rolls-Royce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZeWPlVoLko) and [Verge TS](https://www.vergemotorcycles.com/).

## What do we need? 

- Calculations
- Drawings
- Suppliers of the components

## How can you help?

You can contribute calculations, (3d-)drawings, improve the idea further or find answers to some of the open questions below. Just clone this project and make a pull request.

### Coils (Stator)

- What are the specs for the coils? Wire? Rounds?
- How many? 24?
- Dimensions?
- Can the core be made from hollow rectangle and be bolted to stator cylinder?
- Do all cores need to be united and why?
- Is there a benefit of using [rectangular enamelled copper wire](https://www.lww.se/products/rectangular-enamelled-copper-wire/)?
- Heat issues? Are water cooling or heat dissipation fins required? 

### Permanent magnets (Rotor)

- How many units? [24](https://electrek.co/2019/10/18/rmk-e2-hubless-electric-motorcycle-eicma/)? [48](https://www.frankedirectdrive.com/en/)?
- Optimal [Halbach array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halbach_array) arrangement?
- Dimensions?
- Glued directly to a rim or to outer cylinder?
- Source of magnets with constant weight and force?

### Bearings

- How to seal for a waterproof structure? Should be possible. See [Rolls-Royce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZeWPlVoLko).
- Is the max speed (140km/h) an issue for bearings?
- Integrated or separate ([Franke](https://www.franke-gmbh.com/)) races?

### Tires

- Regular tires will go
- As the motor is part of the rim, seasonal tire changes are more complicated.
